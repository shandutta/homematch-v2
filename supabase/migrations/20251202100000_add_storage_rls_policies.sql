-- Migration: Add Storage RLS Policies for Avatars Bucket
-- Ensures users can only access/modify their own avatar files

-- Allow public read access to all avatars (bucket is public)
CREATE POLICY "Avatars are publicly accessible"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');

-- Allow authenticated users to upload only to their own folder
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload own avatar"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'avatars'
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- Allow users to update only their own avatar files
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own avatar"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'avatars'
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
)
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'avatars'
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- Allow users to delete only their own avatar files
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own avatar"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'avatars'
