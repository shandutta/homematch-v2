**CREATE DESIGN VARIATIONS**

UI TO BUILD: $ARGUMENTS

**GOAL**
Your goal is to spin up 3 parallel sub agents concurrently to implement one UI with variations,
So that users can review and decide which one is better;

**Task for each sub agent**

1. First read and analyze the style guide at `/docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md` using the Read tool, as well as mockups for reference
2. Build one single html page of just one screen to build a UI based on users' feedback/task
3. Output html in ui*iterations folder as ui*{n}.html (Where n needs to be unique like ui_1.html, ui_2.html, etc.)
